# January 2015 edition


This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning Data", available on Coursera platform.

The files available are:

        - ```README.md```      : this file
        - ```CodeBook.MD```    : a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data
        - ```run_analysis.R``` : the R script for performing the data analysis


To obtain the tidy data perform the following steps:

    1. Download and unzip the file https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

    2. Create a folder called "Data" where you desire in your path

    3. Copy inside Data folder the ```test``` and ```train``` folder from unzipped dataset

    4. Copy inside Data folder the file: ```run_analysis.R```, ```activity_labels.txt``` and ```features.txt```

    5. Run the R script by R console or RStudio

    6. In Data folder you will found the tidy data file called ```averages_data.txt```
